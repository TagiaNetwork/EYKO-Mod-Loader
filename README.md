# Election Year Knockout Mod Loader
This is a mod loader designed for the game Election Year Knockout (info below). Currently I only plan on this being a resource mod loader, allowing easy editing of the in-place game resources. Written in python this loader backs up resource files and then replaces them with the mods you wish to load. 

# What is Election Year Knockout?
"Election Year Knockout is a boxing game in the style of the Punch-Out!! series parodying American politics. Set in an alternate reality where literally everything is solved in the boxing ring, even presidential elections, an emerging third-party candidate (controlled by the player) campaigns around the United States of America to battle prominent personalities from the two existing political parties and ascend to the presidency" (https://www.giantbomb.com/election-year-knockout/3030-76110/).
